# SmartFirmware
## Introduction

In 2006 [CodeGen, Inc](http://codegen.com/) released their Open Firmware
implementation under a BSL like license. Their code, entirely written in
ANSI C, contains the following components:

- [SmartFirmwareâ„¢](http://www.codegen.com/SmartFirmware/index.html): an
  ANSI C implementation of the IEEE-1275 Open Firmware boot firmware
  standard. Dramatically reduce and ease your firmware development and
  system bring-up times and costs.
- An [ANSI C
  compiler](http://www.codegen.com/SmartFirmware/ccfcode.html) that
  generates Open Firmware compatible Forth/Fcode makes it easy to
  develop drivers for PCI cards and PMC modules.
