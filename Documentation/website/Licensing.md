# OpenBIOS Licensing

OpenBIOS is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. If you
adapt OpenBIOS to your needs, please contact us with your changes so
that you can contribute your changes back to the community.

# Why GPL?

We see the GPL giving OpenBIOS a big competitive advantage over other
firmware solutions:

- As a hardware vendor you get the warranty that nobody hiddenly
  improves the code you have been contributing without giving those
  improvements back. Thus, GPL guarantees that you keep control over
  your work and contributions.
- End users / customers get great benefit from OpenBIOS being GPL
  licensed: The GPL insures customers that a given platform will act
  like all other OpenBIOS platforms. BSD is a negative marketing point
  where BIOS is concerned.
