## The OpenBIOS Project

The OpenBIOS project coordinates all free and open source implementations
of the Open Firmware standard. Yet our development team is rather
small. You are welcome to contact us, if you

- want to help developing drivers, support for new systems, write
  documentation.
- need help porting Open Firmware to your custom hardware and are
  looking for specialists to get it done.

Of course we appreciate any help, hints, patches, comments, etc.

NOTE: Please read our [Code of Conduct](Code_of_Conduct).

## Mailinglist

Development and other things about OpenBIOS are discussed on the
[OpenBIOS mailing list](Mailinglist). If you want to
contribute, ask questions, get information or have some ideas, please
subscribe to this list. It's currently very low traffic. If you have
patches, feel free to send them to the list, too. Please note: To keep
the amount of spam as low as possible, only subscribed users are allowed
to post to the list.

## Internet Relay Chat

Currently most of the discussion moved over to Internet Relay Chat
(IRC). You can find us on [irc.freenode.net](http://www.freenode.net/)
in \#coreboot. Most people are in CET timezone, so don't give up when
this channels seems very quiet for some time.

Here you have the chance to talk to people being involved or interested
in this project. Most of the discussion is tech talk. There's no need to
ask whether you are allowed to ask. Questions on OpenBIOS, coreboot,
firmware and related topics are welcome.

## Project Maintainer

The OpenBIOS Project is maintained by Stefan Reinauer from [coresystems
GmbH](http://www.coresystems.de). If you have any questions regarding
the project that are beyond the scope of the mailing list, please
contact Stefan.
