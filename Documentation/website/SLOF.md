# SLOF
Slimline Open Firmware (SLOF) is initialization and boot source code
based on the IEEE-1275 (Open Firmware) standard, developed by engineers
of the IBM Corporation.

The SLOF source code provides illustrates what's needed to initialize
and boot Linux or a hypervisor on the industry Open Firmware boot
standard.

Currently the SLOF source code is hosted on github at
<https://github.com/aik/SLOF/> and provides:

- Documentation
- An Open Firmware implementation for prototyping, test, and debug
- Low Level Firmware for IBM's JS20, JS21 and the YDL PowerStation
  (partially closed source)
- Firmware for the emulated 'pseries' machine of QEMU
